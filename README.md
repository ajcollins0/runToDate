# runToDate
Quick tracker to hit Strava's API and report how many miles have been run YTD

### How to use

Run `RunToDate -h` to get a help menu. This program is BYO-api_creds, so you'll need to have a client_id, client_secret, and refresh_token already created. 

If you don't know how to get these values you can create them [here](https://developers.strava.com/). 

If you're having trouble with access, ensure you've followed the steps [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/). 

It's fairly simple to create the APP in strava's website, then use postman to create the refresh_token via the steps listed [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#oauth)
